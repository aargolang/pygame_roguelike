# pygame_roguelike
a simple roguelike made in python with PyGame

short:
I have no idea how far I plan to take this game. I imagine I will just keep working on it until either the game is limited by the language or the game is large enough that I feel it is somewhat complete.

Directions:

	Menu:
	the bracketed character will choose the selection

	Game:
	directional keys to move/attack/talk/trade/pay respects/not die/save the world
