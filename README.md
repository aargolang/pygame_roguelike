# pygame_roguelike
a simple roguelike made in python with PyGame

short:
I have no idea how far I plan to take this game. I imagine I will just keep working on it until either the game is limited by the language or the game is large enough that I feel it is somewhat complete.

Directions:

	Menu:
	the bracketed character will choose the selection

	Game:
	directional keys to move/attack/talk/trade/pay respects/not die/save the world

status:
 + music! sorry if its too loud or annoying. will be developing more themes in the future
 + enemies now follow you with basic AI but they get stuck underneat player because no collision interaction
 
current projects:
 - create an interface that includes health, game messages, threat level, minimap(maybe?plz?), pretty stuff
 - save generated level files per-game to ensure randomized floor tiles are consistent in game
 - actually crate a d20 battle system
 - create wall and floor objects that contain the relevant tileset
 - declutter drawing code
 - make menu selectable with directional keys and enter
 - implement a dialoge system
