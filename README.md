# pygame_roguelike
a simple roguelike made in python with PyGame

short:
I have no idea how far I plan to take this game. I imagine I will just keep working on it until either the game is limited by the language or the game is large enough that I feel it is somewhat complete.

 TODO (3/23/18)
 - possibly reduce memory usage for large maps by only storing the walls
 - figure out how to load enemies into the levels
 - only render a new frame after user input to save processing time
 - clean up floor and wall graphics implementation
 - create wall and floor objects that contain the relevant tileset
 - implement d20 battle system 
 - create level objects that contain starting position and csv filepath
